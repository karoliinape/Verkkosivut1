    <h2>Obedience Training</h2>
    <p>Our obedience training program focuses on teaching your dog basic commands such as sit, stay, and come. These commands are essential for a well-behaved and happy dog.</p>
    
    <h2>Group Training</h2>
    <p>Group training for dogs is a great way to socialize your pet and work on obedience skills in a controlled environment. Group training can also provide the opportunity for dogs to interact with other dogs and learn how to behave in a group.
        This type of training can be especially beneficial for puppies or dogs with behavioral issues, as it allows them to practice good behavior in a supportive environment. Group training classes may cover basic obedience commands,
        leash walking, off-leash training, and other important skills for dogs.</p>
    
    <h2>Behavioral Training</h2>
    <p>If your dog is struggling with behavioral issues such as barking, jumping, or aggression, our behavioral training program can help. I will work with you and your dog to address and correct these unwanted behaviors.</p>

    <p><strong>Contact us with email, if youre interested about in-home training. </strong></p>
